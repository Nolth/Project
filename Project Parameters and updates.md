# Project Idea V1: 4/20/2024
As you know, San Deigo's roads chould be better. In my family, it is wierd if the quaity of our road asn't been broght up in a while. That is why I able looking a road work data. This project is about road work and what road needs the most repairs. I will shifting through Repair projects include City streets that have been repaired since July 1, 2013, (first full fiscal year comprehensive street repair data is readily available) and those that are currently scheduled for repair, arording to the https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/streets-repair-projects/ website. I will be using File, classes, abstract, interface, and other code ideas and symbols to analise this pice of data and see where it is most common. I will also be looking in to what is the most common way they do it as that might be interisting.
